This is my Capstone Project for my Associates of Science at Columbus State Community College. This is a Spring MVC Web App made using the Eclipse IDE designed to be a musicians utility app. The app wil contain features such as a challenge generator for targeted improv or music-writing practice, a metronome, a random chord generator with timed statistics for practicing locating chords across the fretboard or keyboard, and more.

This is a Work In Progress and some features may be incomplete or nonfunctional.

To run the app, open it in Eclipse, run the application.java file, and go to the MusiciansCompanion endpoint at your localhost address.

TODO: 
-Add form validation
-Make ChallengeSettings pass to the client so the challenge page can reload and generate anoother challenge rather than creating an error

Low priority
-Create a login and way to save user preferences. 
-Create a way (incorporating metronome functionality) to follow a chord progression as it plays. E.G 4 bars of Amaj, 2 bars of Dmaj. Show the current chord, how long it's played, and what's coming up. Possibly use this format: Amaj | Amaj | Amaj | Amaj | Dmaj | Dmaj
